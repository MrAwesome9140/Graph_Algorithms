Folder Description:

Each folder for each of the tests have a final_labels, init_labels, and a copy file. 
The init_labels file hold the initial page rank values before the page rank algorithm runs. 
The final_labels holds the values after the page rank algorithm runs, hence the final labels. 
And, lastly, the copy file for each of the tests hold the dimacs graph that we get after we convert
the original dimacs to csr and then back to dimacs to print it out.
